        <p style="text-align:center; margin: 0px 0px 120px 0px"> A comforting snack depicted in the film, Spirited Away, are these ever-so-squishy red bean buns.
        While making these from scratch can be a bit laborious, the end result is well worth it when you get to hold your own squishy
        creation in your own hands. Red bean buns consist of two delicious compononets: a leavened dough wrapper that's pillowy soft
         and fluffy filled with a creamy sweet paste made of adzuki beans. Incredibly unique in flavor, it has been compared to the
         taste of sweet potato with added sugar, as well as creamy and earthy notes.</p>
